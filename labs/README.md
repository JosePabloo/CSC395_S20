# Directory for Mini-Lab assignments

Each week you will practice the concepts by completing a mini lab, which will consist of code implementation and some analysis. For each lab, navigate to that folder (on github) and the assignment instructions will appear on the page. This is the README.md file contained within the folder. You can convert a markdown file (with extension .md) to a pdf through the web. Google "convert markdown to pdf."
